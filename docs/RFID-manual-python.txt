1. step (install python-dev)
sudo apt-get install python-dev

2. step (enable SPI in RPi)
As the SPI is not enabled by default you will need to edit the raspi-blacklsit.conf 
in order to enable the SPI interface; this has been blacklisted as most users 
are not interested in it according to the comment in the file. 
There are only two devices in the file, the SPI and I2C.

sudo vi /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

Add '#' in front of the line spi-bcm2708 to comment it out of the blacklist. 
Save the file, and you will need to reboot the Raspberry PI, 
after which the lsmod command should show the spi device (spi_bcm2708) enabled.

3. step (install SPI-Py library to work with SPI on RPi using python lang)
git clone https://github.com/lthiery/SPI-Py.git
cd SPI-Py
sudo python setup.py install

4. step (install MFRC522 library from github)
git clone https://github.com/rasplay/MFRC522-python.git
cd MFRC522-python
sudo python read.py

5. step (enable device tree)
cd ~
ls /boot/config.txt
sudo nano /boot/config.txt

(... now navigate to end of file and insert code below:)
device_tree=on
(... save changes ...)

6. step (test)
sudo python read.py
